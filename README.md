# **This is the Repository of Charles Braeden McNulty**
My name is Braeden McNulty, a Political Science MAPSS student from [Pikeveille, KY.](http://pikevilleky.gov/)
After graduating from Pikeville High School, I atteneded [Centre College](https://www.centre.edu/) in Danville, KY where I earned a BA in _Political Science_ and _History_. At Centre, I was involved numverous organizations that allowed me to share my love of my school with others. These include: 

1. Student Government
2. First Year Orientation
3. Admissions Tour Guide

During my tenure on Centre's student government, I spearhaeded a project that led to a composting program with our dining services that is still in use today.

#The MAPSS Program
Within the MAPSS program, my thesis is about how religiously framing climate change threats and policy proposals affects the extent to which religious Americans percieve the issue and support policy outcomes. The project stemmed from my upbringing in Pikeville where Coal and Christianity are at the heart of political discussions. Broadly speaking, my interest in the politics of climate change and environmental protection rose from a conversation I had with a friend back home. He is an environmental engineer who dislkes the EPA. When talking to him about the health of local waterways, he is very concerned about corporate pollution. Yet, when environmental protection turns to climate change, he is more hesitant to support regulation. 

#For Fun!
I grew up a rabid Star Wars fan! I actually watched the _Phantom Menace_ when I was in first grade, before I ever watched a few stereotypical 'classic' kids' movies from the late 90s. Contrary to what most people think, my favorite Star Wars movie is _Revenge of the Sith_. Although it is very much like me to enjoy movies with cheesy acting, the Anakin vs. Obi-Wan fight scene is my favorite Star Wars scene.

Most of the commands (e.g. bolding, italics, adding links) were fairly straight forward. The hardest part was creating lists due to the particular nature of the formatting. I talked to Colton after trying a few different syntazes, and he suggested I added some spaces between the code lines. That worked well, and I am confident I can replicate it in the future.
